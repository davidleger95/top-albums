        Agnes Obel is an artist I just stumbled upon one day while listening to
        a playlist on 8tracks (is that still a thing?). The first song I heard
        from her was "The Curse" and I was immediately drawn in by the minimal,
        classical style. Her music quickly became my go-to music for studying
        or just relaxing and having a cup of tea.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Pass Them By" is my favourite song on <em>Aventine</em>. I love the subtle
        acoustic guitar in it and there’s something about the lyrics (see above)
        that I find very satisfying. Sometimes I imagine myself walking through
        a veldt as the wind sweeps over the long blades of wild grass, they
        rustle in the breeze, cheering me as I pass them by.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like the ambiguity of Agnes Obel’s lyrics. She mumbles the words
        in most of her songs which might be a turn-off for some people, but I
        sort of enjoy it because it has led me to listen more attentively and
        sometimes I get to imagine my own lyrics when I can’t quite hear what
        she’s singing.

        <em>Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 1</em> is Lil Peep’s only official
        album, which he released just a few months before his death in
        October 2017. Gaining a large following on SoundCloud, Lil Peep was
        on the verge of making it into the mainstream. His songs were catchy
        and but also dark in theme, which I found to be very cathartic. His
        songs empathize with your sadness, but they can heal your heart and
        change your mood in just seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lil Peep got most of his inspiration from rap and emo music. He
        transformed those genres to create his unique sound. Being just
        21 years old and having already built up a respectful following,
        he would have certainly been an impactful artist in the music industry
        in years to come had he not died.

        Mindless Self Indulgence thrive off their obscene lyrics and
        upbeat electronic punk music. Their name is probably the most
        accurate band name I know of. Their lyrics are consistently both
        mindless and self-indulgent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How I Learned...</em> is the culmination of Mindless Self
        Indulgence’s work throughout their long career as a band. I like
        MSI because their lyrics are simple, dark, and hilarious.
        "It Gets Worse" bluntly tells you that your life is going to get
        worse and you’re going to die alone. But then "Ala Mode" is just
        tells you that no matter how bad life gets, ice cream makes
        everything better. So maybe it balances itself out. There’s a lot
        of randomness to the themes on this album, but one thing in common
        about all the songs is their depressive, dark humour. Sometimes you
        need a good punch in the face. This album can provide that.

        <em>Imaginaerum</em> is probably the most well-rounded album from Nightwish.
        It’s the album that got me into the band and into symphonic metal in
        general. At first, this was the only album from Nightwish I would
        listen to, but after some time I gradually developed a taste for the
        rest of their music as well, going back one album at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the band became more successful, they’ve been able to afford to
        produce better quality recordings overall. Producing music at the
        scale and complexity that Nightwish does on this album — with a full
        orchestra and hundreds of tracks — is rather expensive when compared
        to most bands, who typically just need a handful of people to produce
        a quality album. I think having means to properly produce the
        extravagant sounds they intended has played a large role in making
        <em>Imaginaerum</em> such a great album. Also in the context of <em>Imaginaerum</em>,
        it’s easier to listen to their earlier music and imagine a more
        complete sound. For me, this album improves Nightwish’s previous
        works — it actually makes their older music better in its own
        right —  which makes this album an essential chapter in the band’s
        career.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reasons why I enjoy this album/band so much is because they build
        such an immersive world, and let is as the listener indulge in
        escapism and lament our abandonment of childhood. The music and
        lyrics build a complex narrative with both lyrical and musical
        callbacks to earlier songs across their discography. Often the songs
        take inspiration from classic fairytales, such as Alice’s
        <em>Adventures in Wonderland</em> and <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, ancient mythology,
        and works of classic poets such as Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman.
        If you like to dive down the rabbit hole analyzing music and lyrics,
        <em>Imaginaerum</em> and Nightwish will keep you busy for a good while.

        Into Your Lungs is the oldest album on this list and one that is
        responsible for shaping my current music tastes. Hey Rosetta! is
        without question my favourite band from Atlantic Canada. I remember
        first hearing New Goodbye back in 2008 and falling in love with Hey
        Rosetta!’s music. Even after a full decade of listening to this
        album I’m still not bored of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Into Your Lungs</em> is the band’s first album and I think it has
        remained their best over the years. With each subsequent releases,
        their music style has shifted from indie rock to a more synthetic
        sound and in doing so I think they lost some of what drew me to
        them in the first place. Into Your Lungs stands out to me because
        it creates a complex soundscape, making heavy use of violin, cello,
        and mandolin, in addition to more common instruments like guitar
        and piano.

        Dance Gavin Dance does a good job at not taking themselves too
        seriously, while also being serious about making good music. Even
        though their writing style is fairly superficial and thrives on
        clichés, the band uses that style to present a light-hearted
        perspective on heavier topics such as substance abuse, love and
        heartbreak, and self-reflection on <em>Mothership</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where many artists I listen to talk about serious topics in a
        serious tone. Dance Gavin Dance reminds me that I shouldn’t take
        things too seriously even if they’re serious things. Their music
        frames life’s problems in a not so serious perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think Dance Gavin Dance’s style is able to work so well because
        they pair their unique lyricism with music that fuses elements
        of pop and metal into a sound that is both catchy and gritty. They
        hide some of their more questionable lyrics within dirty vocals.
        Unintelligible at first, and even more insensible when you look
        them up. Makes sense, no?

        Killer Mike and El-P, together known as Run The Jewels (RTJ),
        have been pumping out hard album after hard album over the past
        few years and it just keeps getting better with each release.
      </p>
      <p>Simply put: I like Run The Jewels because it’s hype AF.</p>
      <p>
        Run The Jewels drops hard bars on top of hard beats on every
        track. They’re relentless. Lyrically, RTJ’s main focus is
        unforgiving self-aggrandizement with the some misanthropic
        commentary sprinkled on top. They paint vivid imagery with
        their lyrics that is unmatched in today’s rap scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        I arbitrarily picked their most recent album for this list, but
        <em>RTJ1</em> and <em>RTJ2</em> are both on equal footing with
        <em>RTJ3</em>, and my thoughts here apply to all three albums equally.
        I can’t wait for <em>RTJ4</em>.

        Lights is an interesting artist. I love how she not only makes
        music, but also likes to create visual art and write and illustrate
        her own comics and graphic novels. With her album Skin & Earth,
        she released a comic series that gives additional context and
        meaning to the songs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lights was the first artist to really get me into electronic
        music. I like Lights because she puts a unique twist on electronic
        music. Before hearing Lights for the first time I didn’t think
        electronic music had anything more to offer beyond bass drops
        and dissonant square synths. Everything else I heard from the
        genre didn’t do much for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first got into Lights with the release of her album <em>Siberia</em>.
        Her next album after that, <em>Little Machines</em>, didn’t resonate with
        me as much though. <em>Skin And Earth</em> got me back into her music again
        though. I don’t have too much to say about this album specifically,
        other than that I like it the most out of all albums from Lights.
        She really did an amazing job with all the tracks on <em>Skin And Earth</em>.

        Lamb of God are easily the heaviest band on this list. Even the
        lead singer, Randy Blythe, once described their music as
        “unlistenable”, but they’re still one of my favourite bands. I feel
        a strong connection with Randy’s writing style; I think his lyrics
        often mirror the style and themes of my own writing so his words
        resonate with me on a very intimate level.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>VII: Sturm Und Dran</em> is the pinnacle of Lamb of God’s discography.
        The album is filled with bangers and gives clever critiques on
        modern day topics such as mainstream media and social media with
        the songs "Engage The Fear Machine" and "Delusion Pandemic". "Overlord"
        stands apart from the rest of Lamb of God’s entire career as it is
        the first time we hear clean vocals from Randy Blythe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The song "512" is one of the highlights of the album, recounting the
        time Randy spent in prison in Prague, Czech Republic while on trial
        for his involvement in the death of a fan at one of their shows a
        few years prior. Eventually he was found not guilty and released,
        but he was certainly shaken by the experience and the lyrics in
        this song reveal the internal struggle he went through, the guilt
        and remorse he felt. The band produced a documentary,
        <em>As The Palaces Burn</em>, which tells more details about the incident.

        Bring Me The Horizon has switched up their style quite a bit in
        recent years. The band’s earlier music is some of the heaviest in
        the metal genre, but with their two most recent albums, <em>Sempiternal</em>
        and <em>That’s The Spirit</em>, they’ve gone in a more mainstream direction.
        However, some elements of their music are rooted in their previous
        style, such as lyrical themes and influences from electronic music.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like <em>That’s The Spirit</em> because it shows that the band is
        comfortable exploring new directions and evolving their sound over
        time. It’s certainly the most approachable album in the band’s
        discography and it shows off the vocal of their lead singer,
        Ollie Sykes. I think if you’re going to like anything from Bring Me
        The Horizon, <em>That’s The Spirit</em> is the album to start with.
        However, the opening and closing tracks are the weakest on the
        album in my opinion. Aside from that, I like every track on
        this album to a reasonable degree.

        The National have a very hypnotic sound to their music that evokes a
        melancholy deep within. <em>Trouble Will Find Me</em> is the first album I
        heard from the band and still remains my favourite. Although I’ve
        explored some of the band’s older music, nothing else from them has
        had such a lasting impression on me as this album.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lyrics on <em>Trouble Will Find Me</em> alternate between specifics and
        abstracts — between story and emotion. I like how the album
        gives names to characters in the songs. The characters and
        their stories breathe life into the music, grounding the songs in
        reality, which is a stark contrast to the abstract lyrics that
        surround them. I think this really pays off when Jennifer, who
        is first mentioned in "Fireproof", reappears in the song
        "This Is The Last Time" as Jenny. Knowing that these songs are
        about the same person helps build a more cohesive character
        and narrative. It suggests looking for other, less explicit,
        connections between the songs that wouldn’t be there otherwise.

        ’68 just rocks out hard and holds nothing back. I first
        discovered this rock duo shortly before they released their
        first album (<em>In Humour and Sadness</em>) and I’ve been a fan of their
        stripped-down punk rock ever since.

        With bands that come out strong on their first album I’m
        always nervous about their follow up album, but <em>Two Parts Viper</em>
        sure delivered on my expectations as the band’s second album.
        It built on what worked from <em>In Humour And Sadness</em> and explored
        a few new directions, one of which included some spoken-word
        parts on "No Apologies" that reminded me of one of my favourite
        poets, Allen Ginsberg.

        ’68 also put on incredible live performances with arrangements
        that differ from the recordings. I’ll often watch videos of their
        concerts and session recordings because they always play variants
        of their songs that add new layers of intrigue.
